# zap2xml

Automate TV guides to XMLTV format. Easy to use, up-to-date. See below for getting started.

I also *somewhat* maintain a version of the original in the [historical-perl branch](https://github.com/jesmannstl/zap2xml/tree/historical-perl) if you're interested in that.

* Added <date> tag to all programs without an aired date normalized to America/New York
* Added xmltv_ns with the date aired as Season YYYY Episode MMYY to Non Movie or Sports with no other Season/Episode like local news so would have the ability to record as Series is most players.
